<h1>Home Lab</h1>
This is me creating a Home lab in Azure. I used 2 VMs, connected one VM to the local host I set up. I used Active Directory, created users, set GPOs, and admin capabilities. 
Shared folder settings with users etc. I definitely enjoyed this. Please feel free to speed this up, I didn't realize how long this was. <br />
